Starting reading patches at line 52546.
For group 1 named outlet trying to read 4 patch face indices.
For group 2 named inlet trying to read 128 patch face indices.
For group 3 named atmosphere trying to read 384 patch face indices.
For group 5 named walls trying to read 1804 patch face indices.

Of 3916 so-called boundary faces 1596 belong to two cells and are therefore internal
Sorting boundary faces according to group (patch)
0: outlet is patch
1: inlet is patch
2: atmosphere is patch
3: walls is patch

Constructing mesh with non-default patches of size:
    outlet	4
    inlet	128
    atmosphere	384
    walls	1804
